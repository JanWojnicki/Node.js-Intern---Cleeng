Event-Driven Notification Orchestrator
This service handles user notification preferences for events generated by a SaaS product. It provides a simple API to manage user settings and decides whether a notification should be sent for a given event based on those settings.
This project fulfills all core requirements, including the "Do Not Disturb" logic, and also implements the following bonus features:
Input Validation: All POST endpoints use the zod library to validate incoming data, ensuring robustness and data integrity.
Unit Testing: The critical "Do Not Disturb" (DND) logic is thoroughly tested using Jest to guarantee correctness, especially for edge cases like overnight time windows.
ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
npm (usually comes with Node.js)

1. Installation
   Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd notification-orchestrator
   npm install

2. Running the Application
   You can run the server in two modes:
   A) Development Mode
   This uses nodemon to automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code.
   npm run dev

B) Production Mode
This builds the TypeScript code into JavaScript and then runs the compiled application.
npm run build
npm start

Once started, the server will be running at http://localhost:3000. 3. Running Unit Tests
To run the Jest unit tests for the DND logic, use the following command:
npm test

You will see a pass/fail summary for all test cases in your terminal.

}

Success Response (200 OK): { "message": "Preferences updated successfully." }
Error Response (400 Bad Request): If the body format is invalid.
GET /preferences/:userId
Retrieves the saved preferences for a specific user.
URL Params: userId=[string]
Success Response (200 OK): The user's preference object.
Error Response (404 Not Found): If no preferences are found for the user.
Process Events
POST /events
Receives an event and decides if a notification should be sent based on user preferences.
Body (raw/json):
{
"eventId": "evt_abcde",
"userId": "usr_123",
"eventType": "item_shipped",
"timestamp": "2025-09-13T23:00:00Z"
}

Response Scenarios:
202 Accepted: The notification should be sent.
{ "decision": "PROCESS_NOTIFICATION" }

200 OK: The notification should not be sent. The reason is provided.
// DND is active

## Overview

This project implements an event-driven Notification Orchestrator intended for SaaS platforms. It provides:

- A lightweight API to store and retrieve user notification preferences.
- Per-user "Do Not Disturb" (DND) windows to suppress notifications during quiet hours (including overnight ranges).
- Per-event-type subscription toggles (enable/disable specific event notifications).

The codebase is written in TypeScript and includes input validation and unit tests for the core DND logic.

---

## Key Features

- Do Not Disturb (DND) handling with correct overnight window semantics.
- Input validation on POST endpoints using `zod`.
- Unit tests (Jest) that cover normal and edge cases for DND logic.
- Simple, extensible data model for event settings per user.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (recommended)
- npm

### Install

Clone and install dependencies:

```pwsh
git clone <repository-url>
cd notification-orchestrator
npm install
```

### Run (Development)

```pwsh
npm run dev
```

This runs the TypeScript code with automatic restarts on change (nodemon).

### Run (Production)

```pwsh
npm run build
npm start
```

The server listens on http://localhost:3000 by default.

---

## API Reference

All endpoints assume JSON bodies and return JSON responses. Errors use standard HTTP status codes.

### Manage Preferences

#### POST /preferences/:userId

Create or update a user's preferences.

URL params

- `userId` (string)

Body example

```json
{
  "dnd": { "start": "22:00", "end": "07:00" },
  "eventSettings": {
    "item_shipped": { "enabled": true },
    "invoice_generated": { "enabled": false }
  }
}
```

Success: 200 OK

```json
{ "message": "Preferences updated successfully." }
```

Errors: 400 Bad Request when payload invalid.

---

#### GET /preferences/:userId

Retrieve saved preferences for `userId`.

Success: 200 OK with JSON preferences. 404 Not Found if not present.

---

### Process Events

#### POST /events

Accepts an incoming event and returns a decision whether to notify.

Body example

```json
{
  "eventId": "evt_abcde",
  "userId": "usr_123",
  "eventType": "item_shipped",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-13T23:00:00Z"
}
```

Responses

- 202 Accepted â€” Notification should be sent

  ```json
  { "decision": "PROCESS_NOTIFICATION" }
  ```

- 200 OK â€” Notification suppressed; reason provided

  ```json
  { "decision": "DO_NOT_NOTIFY", "reason": "DND_ACTIVE" }
  ```

  or

  ```json
  { "decision": "DO_NOT_NOTIFY", "reason": "USER_UNSUBSCRIBED_FROM_EVENT" }
  ```

- 400 Bad Request â€” Invalid payload

---

## Testing

Run unit tests (Jest):

```pwsh
npm test
```

The project includes focused tests for the DND logic, covering overnight intervals and boundary conditions.

---

## Postman Examples
